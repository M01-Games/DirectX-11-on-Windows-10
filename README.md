# Introduction #
This is a C++ desktop application that allows the user to build a 3D scene using DirectX 11 on windows 10,
by hard coding all the features and watching the scene come to life in an appication. 

This project has taken inspiration from https://www.rastertek.com/tutdx11win10.html

## Plans ##
1. To add the ability to switch camera positions
2. To add the ability to switch lights on and off
3. To add the ability to toggle movement in objects
4. To build a town for the environment
5. To add distinct lighting to the town
6. To add distinct texture and lighting effects
7. ...
